2. **LITERATURE SURVEY** 

**Functionality  and  Features:**  A  critical  aspect  of  the College  Management  System  (CMS)  is  the  range  of features  offered  to  different  user  groups.  Kumar  and Gupta  (2018)  emphasize  that  modern  CMS  should integrate  functionalities  such  as  student  enrolment, attendance  tracking,  grading  systems,  and communication tools. Their study revealed that systems allowing  real-time  data  access  improved  student engagement  and  facilitated  timely  feedback  from educators. 

` `Sharma and Verma  (2019) discuss the importance of mobile  accessibility,  noting  that  responsive  design increases usability and ensures that students can access critical  information  anytime  and  anywhere.  User Experience and Engagement Ali et al. (2020) focused on the user experience (UX) of CMS and asserted that a user-friendly interface is essential for promoting student interaction and satisfaction. Their findings indicate that intuitive  navigation  and  clear  design  elements significantly  impact  users'  willingness  to  utilize  the system.  

Similarly, Patel and Desai (2021) explored the role of user  feedback  in  system  development,  advocating iterative design processes that incorporate student and faculty inputs to enhance the platform's functionality. 

` `**Data management and data security:** This is another crucial aspect of CMS, particularly in the storage and processing of sensitive information. According to Singh and Rani (2020), secure data storage solutions such as cloud-based  systems  are  vital  for  protecting  user information. Their study highlighted the effectiveness of employing  encryption  and  authentication  protocols  to safeguard  data  from  unauthorized  access.  Khan  et  al. (2021)  underscored  the  importance  of  data  analytics within  CMS,  suggesting  that  the  ability  to  analyze student  performance  metrics  can  lead  to  targeted interventions  and  improved  educational  outcomes. Because of the integration of Emerging Technologies, the CMS is a growing area of interest. 

**Artificial Intelligence and Machine Learning** 

Furthermore,  Gupta  and  Sinha  (2023)  examine  the potential  of  block-chain  technology  for  maintaining transparent  and  tamper-proof  records  of  student achievements and transactions learning. 

3. **EXISTING SYSTEM** 

The  website  of  Jamia  Millia  Islamia  (JMI)  has  many helpful features aimed at students, faculty, staff, and the general public. To begin with, the first impression of the websiteâ€™s homepage is that it is simple and neat; thus, different pages are easy to navigate. There are clear-cut links to relevant sections, such as admissions, academic departments, notifications, and research-related events. 

One of the most important components of the website is the admission section, which targets future students. All admission  policies, procedures, eligibility  criteria,  and relevant dates can be found. They can simply log onto an  online  platform  through  which  they  can  request admission, track their application  progress,  and check the  final  outcome.  It  also  acts  as  an  admission registration center during the admission period, making it easier for both students and management. 

For  existing  students,  the  results  of  the  examination section  are  among  the  most  accessible  areas.  In  this section, students are able to see their end-of-term results and  other  examination  announcements  as  well  as download the relevant result slips. Other services that the  section  did  not  provide  included  services  or  an academic calendar. They provided a timetable structure for  the  academic  year  that  included  dates  for examinations, breaks, and other relevant functions of the university. 

Each  academic  department  has  a  page  on  the  Jamia Millia Islamia website. The departmental pages contain information about the members of the faculty, a list of offered  courses,  ongoing  research,  and  recent department news. This is especially beneficial to current students and students who are considering admission to Jamia Millia Islamia and want to know about study or collaboration opportunities.

4. **PROBLEM IN EXISTING SYSTEM** 

The website of Jamia Millia Islamia effectively supports academic  and  administrative  needs  but  could  benefit from  several  enhancements  to  improve  usability  and functionality.  Currently,  the  platform  lacks  critical features,  such  as  complaint  registration,  digital attendance  tracking,  internal  mark  access,  online assignment  submission,  and  enhanced  communication tools,  which  would  make  it  more  user-friendly  and efficient. 

A significant drawback is the absence of a centralized complaint  registration  system.  Students  lack  a  formal platform to express grievances related to academics or administration,  which  leads  to  delays  and  frustration. Introducing a complaint feature would streamline issue- reporting, ensure timely responses, and allow students to track the progress of their complaints. 

Attendance  management  is  another  area  that  requires improvement.  The  manual  recording  methods that are currently used are error-prone and inefficient. A digital attendance  system  integrated  with  the  website  could automate  tracking,  provide  real-time  updates  for students,  and  reduce  administrative  efforts  for  faculty members. Notifications of attendance status via mobile integration would also keep students informed of their academic standing. 

Additionally,  lack  of  access  to  internal  marks  poses challenges  for  students  in  tracking  their  academic progress. Incorporating a feature to view internal marks online  would  enhance  transparency,  allow  students  to monitor their performance, and help identify areas for improvement. This would also alleviate the burden on the faculty to address frequent grade-related inquiries. 

The assignment submission process, which still relies on physical formats, can be modernized through an online system. This would enable students to submit their work digitally and receive feedback promptly, ensuring better organization  and  efficiency  for  both  students  and teachers. 

Finally,  an  integrated  communication  system  can improve  interactions  among  students,  faculty,  and administrators. Features such as direct messaging, group chats, and discussion forums can create a collaborative learning  environment  and  enhance  responsiveness  to academic and administrative queries. 

In conclusion, while the Jamia Millia Islamia website fulfills  its  basic  purpose, adding  these features  would transform it into a comprehensive platform supporting 

the  diverse  needs  of  its  users  and  fostering  a  more efficient and interactive university experience 

5. **PROPOSED  METHODOLOGY Requirement Analysis** 

   In  the  initial  phase  of  the  project's  development,  we assessed the needs of the college and its stakeholders, including  students,  faculty  members,  administrative staff, heads of sections, and placement coordinators.  

   To gather requirements, we conducted interviews with the faculty, administrators, and students. Students were tasked with uploading their assignments, downloading their  attendance  reports,  reviewing  their  grades,  and submitting complaints.  

   Faculty members are responsible for scheduling classes, recording  attendance,  and  updating  studentsâ€™  grades. Administrators manage complaints, oversee attendance records,  verify  grades,  validate  new  registrations  for teachers  and  students,  and  update  and  maintain  the system.  

   The  Head  of  the  Section  is  charged  with  managing timetables,  addressing  complaints,  approving  or rejecting  functions,  and  facilitating  meetings  among branch  teachers.  The  Placement  Coordinator  oversees job posts, teaching responsibilities, and communication efforts.  

   The  principal  is  involved  in  escalating  complaints, conducting meetings between the heads of sections, and making decisions regarding the approval or rejection of functions.

**Fig 2. Level-0 Data Flow Diagram of CMS System Internal View:** 

**UI/UX Design** 

We  designed  the  architecture  according  to  our requirements.  Here,  we  demonstrate  how  the  client interacts with the system, how the system interacts with servers,  and  how  the  server  fetches  data  from  the database.We  designed  an  Entity-Relationship  (ER) diagram  of  our  system.  It  shows  how  the  data  of students, faculty, and staff managed 

Define database schema (MySQL). 

1) **Technology Selection** 
- Frontend:- HTML, CSS , JavaScript 
- Backend:- PHP 
- Database :- MySQL 
- Authentication  :-  JWT  or  OAuth2  for  secure login 
- Version Control :Git-Hub for code management 
2) **Development Phase** **Agile Model** 

   To  meet  these  requirements,  we  used  Agile  in  the Software Development Model Lifecycle (SDLC) for our project, which is more effective. This model breaking down a project into smaller manageable modules is an important  strategy  in  project  management,  especially when  dealing  with  complex  systems  such  as  college management  systems  or  university  conferences  The modular  approach  ensures  the  division  a  project  into specific, straightforward components, each of which can be developed, tested and integrated independently Not only  does  it  reduce  project  complexity  but  it  also ![](Aspose.Words.eedad0ed-cbc3-4996-b0aa-578fb879bea8.006.png)

   increases  focus,  enabling  teams  to  do  it  work  in  a specific  area  without  being  overwhelmed  by  the  big picture  This  structured  work  schedule  simplifies, reduces risks, and increases the scale of the project with greater  flexibility.  Each  module  can  be  assigned  to specific  groups,  allowing  for  parallel  and  accelerated development.  It  is  equally  important  to  define  clear objectives  for  key  modules  to  ensure  that  the  project remains operational and meets its intended objectives. Each module must have specific objectives, timelines, and deliverables consistent with the overall objectives of the  project.  For  example,  in  a  college  management system,  important  modules  may  include  attendance management,  assignment,  internal  score  control, communication system, and complaint registry 

3) **Testing Phase** 

Test individual modules for functionality. It is necessary to  ensure  that  these  modules  interact  correctly.  Our architectural design allowed us to verify the flow of the work. 

4) **Deployment** 

We update all codes on our Git-Hub and then connect them  to  a  Dynamic  Hosting  website.  We  bought  a domain to launch on the website. 

5) **Maintenance and Update** 

The maintenance team constantly inspects the system for any issues and tries to incorporate new features based on user feedback. 

6) **Documentation** 

The  Documentation  Team  offers  comprehensive information  about  our  systemâ€™s  API,  codebase,  and database structure, as well as a guidebook for operating the system based on the IEEE standard. 

6. **PROPOSED SYSTEM** 

The  proposed  system  for  the  Jamia  Millia  Islamia initiative  aims  to  address  the  current  limitations  of existing campus spaces by introducing comprehensive digital  solutions  that  enhance  academic  and  business activities. The new system will be designed as a central location where students, faculty, and administrators can efficiently  manage  critical  aspects  of  university operations. This digital approach focuses on complaint registration,  digital  tracking,  scoring,  assignment 

referrals,  and  improved  communication  channels  to create a more intuitive experience for all stakeholders. 

**Features of the Proposed System** 

1) **Complain  Registration  System:**  The  proposed system  has  a  user-friendly  grievance  register  that enables  students  to  submit  complaints  regarding academic  and  administrative  issues.  This  policy  will ensure that students can file grievances in a structured manner, receive acknowledgment of their submissions, and track the progress of their grievances to resolutions. This  will  increase  transparency  and  ensure  prompt action by relevant authorities. 
1) **Digital  Attendance  Tracking:**  The  significant improvement  in  the  proposed  system  is  the  transition from manual attendance tracking to digital attendance tracking.  This  feature  allows  teachers  to  access  the sessions in real-time via a web interface or mobile app with automatic updates posted to the central database. Students will also have access to their academic records online, which will help them track their academic status. In  addition,  this  feature  reduces  the  administrative workload and eliminates any gaps in attendance records. 
1) **Internal  Assessment:**  To  ensure  visibility  in academic  achievement,  the  proposed  system  provides access  to  studentsâ€™  internal  assessment  scores  online. This real-time system provides students with feedback on coursework, projects, and assessments to help them understand  their  academic  progress  and  areas  for improvement. Teachers can enter internal scores directly into  the  system,  simplifying  the  grading  process  and eliminating the need for manual record-keeping. 
1) **Online  Assignment:**  The  existing  platform  has excellent  capabilities  for  submitting  assignments  over the  Internet.  An  assignment  can  be  uploaded  by  the teacher,  and  the  task  completion  deadline  can  be provided along with the instructions. A student is able to submit  his  or  her  assignment,  check  whether  the submission has been accepted, and receive a response from  the  teacher.  All  of  these  occur  within  a  single system.  This  will  help  the  instructor  assess  the assignments  that  were  uploaded  and  displayed  the scores.  This  makes  the  process  conducive  and manageable for learners and parents. 
1) **Elimination of communication barriers:** This new system  features  an  inbuilt  system  to  enhance communication  between  students  and  their  faculty, department  heads,  and  administrators.  This  system enables  users  to  send  messages  to  each  other,  ask questions, and solve queries within the system. It also 

   supports activities such as group discussions, seminars, and  other  forums  in  which  students  and  teachers  can either  collaborate  for  learning  purposes  or  discuss services. This particular benefit will enhance the way communication  occurs.  This  will shorten the time  for those  seeking  answers  and  change  the  climate  of  the place into one that is more interactive.
